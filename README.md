### What is Blaze?
Blaze is a webapp designed to predict the probabilities of different pathologies visible under a human chest xray. It aims to co-pilot and assist medical professionals to diagnose patients accurately and efficiently.

### How can I use it?
Firstly, you need to make sure you have installed and started up the server. After you start it you get one of two URL's, which will look like the following: `http://0.0.0.0:13520` or something similar to `http://90eu-285-11-20-34.ngrok.io`. After that, you can simply visit the url to use the webapp. Note that the first type of URL is only accessible from the host device.
